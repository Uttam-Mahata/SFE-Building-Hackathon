```

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Secure Device (Expected: ✅ LOW Risk)**
- Clean, non-rooted Android device
- Valid SIM card present
- App signature verified
- No debugger attached
- **Result**: All security checks pass, payments allowed

### **Scenario 2: Compromised Device (Expected: ❌ HIGH Risk)**
- Rooted device detected
- No SIM card or invalid network
- App tampered or debug mode
- **Result**: Security failures detected, payments blocked

### **Scenario 3: Partial Issues (Expected: ⚠️ MEDIUM Risk)**
- Some security checks pass, others fail
- **Result**: Enhanced monitoring, additional verification required

## 📊 **Live Monitoring & Logs**

### **Android Logs (Real-time Security Assessment)**
```bash
# Watch SFE ecosystem logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(SfPay|SFE|Security)"

# Expected output:
D/SfPayApplication: SFE SDK initialized during app startup
D/SFPayMainViewModel: Background security checks completed
D/SfeBackendService: Authentication successful with SFE backend
D/SFPayMainViewModel: ✓ SFE Ecosystem Complete Flow ✓
D/SFPayMainViewModel: Payment transaction successful!
```

### **Backend Logs (Security Policy Enforcement)**
```bash
# Backend service logs show:
INFO  AttestationVerificationService: Play Integrity token verified
DEBUG PolicyEnforcementService: Risk assessment: LOW
INFO  PaymentProcessingService: Transaction approved
DEBUG TelemetryService: Compliance data recorded
```

## 🎯 **Key Integration Points**

### **1. Frontend to Backend Communication**
```kotlin
// SfeBackendService handles complete API integration
val authResult = backendService.authenticateWithSfePayload(
    username = "demo@gradientgeeks.com",
    password = "demo123", 
    sfePayload = securityPayload
)

val transactionResult = backendService.initiatePaymentTransaction(
    amount = 1500.0,
    currency = "USD",
    recipient = "John Doe",
    sfePayload = currentSecurityPayload
)
```

### **2. Backend Security Processing**
```java
// PaymentProcessingService with SFE integration
@Service
public class PaymentProcessingService {
    public TransactionResponse processPayment(InitiateTransactionRequest request) {
        // Parse frontend SFE payload
        AttestationRequest attestationRequest = parseSfePayload(request.getSfePayload());
        
        // Verify with Google Play Integrity
        AttestationResponse attestationResponse = 
            attestationService.verifyAttestation(attestationRequest);
        
        // Apply security policies
        String riskLevel = policyService.assessRisk(attestationRequest, attestationResponse);
        
        // Record compliance telemetry
        telemetryService.recordTelemetry(createTelemetryEvent(attestationRequest));
        
        // Execute transaction based on security assessment
        return executeTransactionDecision(request, riskLevel, attestationResponse);
    }
}
```

### **3. Real-time UI Updates**
```kotlin
// MainViewModel provides live security status
data class SecurityStatus(
    val overallStatus: String = "secure", // "secure", "warning", "insecure"
    val message: String = "Device verified by SFE backend",
    val showBanner: Boolean = false
)

data class DetailedSecurityInfo(
    val deviceBinding: String = "passed",
    val rootDetection: String = "passed",
    val debugDetection: String = "passed", 
    val tamperDetection: String = "passed",
    val playIntegrity: String = "passed"
)
```
